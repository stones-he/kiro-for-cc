# Requirements Document: Modular Design Structure

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Kiro for Claude Code extension by introducing a modular approach to design documentation. Currently, the spec workflow generates a single monolithic design.md file. This feature will refine the design document into specialized modules including frontend design, mobile design, server design (API, logic, database models), and test cases. This modular structure will improve maintainability, clarity, and enable parallel development across different technical domains.

The modular design structure will allow developers to work on specific aspects of the system independently while maintaining a cohesive overall design. It will also enable Claude Code to generate more focused and detailed design specifications for each module.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Module Structure Definition

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want the design document to be split into distinct modules (frontend, mobile, server, test cases), so that I can focus on specific technical domains independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates the design phase for a spec THEN the system SHALL create separate design module files instead of a single design.md file.
2. WHEN the modular design structure is enabled THEN the system SHALL create the following module files in the spec directory:
   - design-frontend.md for frontend/web design specifications
   - design-mobile.md for mobile application design specifications
   - design-server-api.md for server API design specifications
   - design-server-logic.md for server business logic design specifications
   - design-server-database.md for database models and schema design
   - design-testing.md for test case specifications
3. WHEN generating design modules THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency and cross-references between related modules.
4. WHEN a user views the spec directory THEN the system SHALL display all design modules in a logical hierarchical structure in the Spec Explorer.

### Requirement 2: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user of Kiro for Claude Code, I want my existing specs with single design.md files to continue working, so that I don't have to migrate all my previous work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects an existing design.md file in a spec directory THEN the system SHALL continue to support reading and editing that file.
2. WHEN a user opens a spec with a legacy design.md file THEN the system SHALL provide an option to migrate to the modular structure.
3. IF a spec contains both design.md and modular design files THEN the system SHALL prioritize the modular design files and display a warning about the duplicate.
4. WHEN a user chooses to migrate a legacy design.md THEN the system SHALL intelligently split the content into appropriate module files based on content analysis.

### Requirement 3: Module Generation and AI Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using Claude Code, I want the AI to generate detailed module-specific design content, so that each technical domain receives appropriate depth and focus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating design modules THEN the system SHALL use specialized AI prompts for each module type that focus on domain-specific concerns.
2. WHEN generating frontend design THEN the system SHALL include component architecture, state management, routing, UI/UX patterns, and styling approaches.
3. WHEN generating mobile design THEN the system SHALL include platform-specific considerations (iOS/Android), native vs hybrid decisions, offline capabilities, and mobile-specific UI patterns.
4. WHEN generating server API design THEN the system SHALL include REST/GraphQL endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication/authorization, and API versioning strategies.
5. WHEN generating server logic design THEN the system SHALL include business rules, service layer architecture, data processing flows, and integration patterns.
6. WHEN generating database design THEN the system SHALL include entity models, relationships, indexes, migrations strategy, and data consistency approaches.
7. WHEN generating testing design THEN the system SHALL include unit test strategies, integration test plans, e2e test scenarios, and testing frameworks.
8. WHEN the AI generates any module THEN the system SHALL ensure cross-module consistency by referencing requirements and related modules.

### Requirement 4: User Interface and Navigation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily navigate between different design modules in the Spec Explorer, so that I can quickly access the specific design information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a spec has modular design files THEN the Spec Explorer SHALL display a "Design Modules" node that expands to show all available modules.
2. WHEN a user clicks on a design module in the Spec Explorer THEN the system SHALL open that module file in the editor.
3. WHEN viewing a design module THEN the system SHALL provide CodeLens links to related modules and requirements.
4. IF a design module is missing THEN the Spec Explorer SHALL display it with a distinctive icon indicating it needs to be generated.
5. WHEN a user right-clicks on a design module in the Spec Explorer THEN the system SHALL provide context menu options to regenerate, review, or delete that specific module.

### Requirement 5: Module-Specific Workflow

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to be able to generate and review design modules independently, so that I can approve different technical domains separately and enable parallel development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in the design phase THEN the system SHALL allow users to generate all modules at once or generate specific modules individually.
2. WHEN a user initiates "Generate All Design Modules" THEN the system SHALL create all applicable modules based on the requirements analysis.
3. WHEN a user initiates "Generate Specific Module" THEN the system SHALL create only the selected module type.
4. WHEN a design module is generated THEN the system SHALL mark it as "pending review" in the workflow state.
5. WHEN reviewing a design module THEN the system SHALL allow approval or rejection of individual modules without affecting other modules.
6. WHEN all required design modules are approved THEN the system SHALL allow progression to the tasks phase.
7. IF any design module is rejected THEN the system SHALL allow regeneration of that specific module without regenerating approved modules.

### Requirement 6: Module Applicability and Smart Detection

**User Story:** As a developer working on a frontend-only feature, I want the system to generate only relevant design modules, so that I don't have unnecessary documentation for components that don't exist in my feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing requirements THEN the system SHALL determine which design modules are applicable based on the feature scope.
2. IF requirements indicate frontend-only changes THEN the system SHALL generate only frontend and testing design modules.
3. IF requirements indicate backend-only changes THEN the system SHALL generate only server-related and testing design modules.
4. IF requirements indicate full-stack changes THEN the system SHALL generate all applicable design modules.
5. WHEN the user manually requests a module that was deemed inapplicable THEN the system SHALL generate it with a warning that it may not be relevant.
6. WHEN generating tasks THEN the system SHALL consider only the modules that were generated and approved.

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to configure which design modules my team uses and customize their structure, so that the extension adapts to our team's specific development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the extension THEN the system SHALL provide settings to enable/disable the modular design feature globally.
2. WHEN the modular design feature is disabled THEN the system SHALL use the legacy single design.md approach.
3. WHEN configuring module structure THEN the system SHALL allow users to define custom module types beyond the default set.
4. WHEN defining custom modules THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify custom file naming patterns and AI prompt templates.
5. IF custom modules are defined THEN the system SHALL use those definitions instead of or in addition to the default modules.
6. WHEN settings are modified THEN the system SHALL apply changes to new specs while preserving existing spec structures.

### Requirement 8: Cross-Module References and Consistency
